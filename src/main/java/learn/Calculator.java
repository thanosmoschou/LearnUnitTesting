 * 
 * Unit testing: A type of software testing where one individual piece of code(unit) is being tested
 * by itself. Unit test isolates one single piece of code and verifies that that piece is working correctly.
 * In Java a unit is a class or a method inside a class. So unit test is code that hits that individual method
 * that you want to test and verify that it's doing exactly what it should do.
